# vs-constoso-oct-2016

This is source code for the Constoso University web application provided as a demo/tutorial by Microsoft. We'll be using it as our example for the Visual Studio presentation.

This is a very slightly modified version that is updated for VS 2015 and has a stub for a testing project.

You can learn more about the Constoso tutorial here: https://www.asp.net/mvc/overview/getting-started/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application

If you download this project, and get it to open in Visual Studio reasonably correctly (to the point where you can open the project files from Solution Explorer), that gets you to "good enough". You don't really need to be able to run the project to follow along for most of the presentation.

That said, you should be able to get the project to run if you a) refresh any missing packages, and b) run Update-Database from the Package Manager console. You might have to fiddle with the Web.config connection setting string depending on what local database server you're running. See also description.html in the root folder for a bit more setup instruction. (If you can press Ctrl-F5 and a new web page with Contoso University in big hero letters shows up, you're good.)

Don't sweat it if you can't get the project to run. It's a nice to have but not essential for the presentation.
